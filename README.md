# CarRacer

This is a simple Python file using Class Structures.
There are two types of cars: GasCar and ElectricCar
Randomly assigns top speeds, Colours, Brands, and Car Type for each Car
Fills / charges Gas and Battery levels before Race starts.
Then calculates the maximum possible distance for each Car depending on their Gas/Battery level and Speed
By standard, the races last 5 hours, with speeds being KM/H.
The highest distance driven is delcared the winner

A Simple Race Board is then printed showing the final gas and battery levels for each Vehicle, along with the Race Winner.
